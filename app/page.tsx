        <Greeting />
        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl leading-relaxed mb-4">
          i like designing frontend interfaces and developing scalable backend
          systems using modern frameworks.

          <p>
            i first got into coding by scripting batch files when i was young,
            then i got curious about the web and moved to html and javascript. i
            also built various c# programs and eventually fell deep into web
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            i have been writing code for about five years now. in that time
            i&apos;ve tried a bit of everything; discord bots, papermc plugins,
            minecraft modding, desktop & game development, even music production
            and video editing at one point.
          </p>
          <p>
            i ended up here because i genuinely enjoy this stuff, not because
            someone told me it was a good career. that&apos;s probably why i
            still enjoy it the same way i did when i first started.
          </p>
          <p>
            these days i care a lot about structure. i like writing code that
            future me won&apos;t be scared to open, and i try to build things in
            a way that feels obvious. frameworks change all the time, but good
            decisions age well.

            i occasionally write about things i learn. mostly so i don&apos;t
            forget them, but also because explaining something is the best way
            to find out if you actually understand it.
